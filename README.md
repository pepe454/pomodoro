## Science says, rest up!

When you take a break from learning or work, your mind switches to diffuse mode.
This is a type of thinking that allows your brain to do work in the background, chugging
away at a problem without you even thinking about it.

Try to take your mind off the work by doing a favorite activity like walking, reading,
surfing the web, or playing music.

It will also make your learning more fun. Give it a try!
